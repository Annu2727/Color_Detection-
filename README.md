# Color_Detection-
This project implements a simple color detection system using OpenCV. It can detect and identify different colors in an image based on HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color ranges. Users can click on any pixel in the image to detect its color. The system is designed to identify multiple colors such as red, green, blue, yellow, black, and white and we can add more color as per the requirements.

- **HSV Ranges**: Uses predefined HSV ranges for detecting each color.
- **Interactive**: Click on any pixel in the image to detect its color.
- **OpenCV**: Uses OpenCV for image processing and user interface.
  
#Usage
1. Replace the image_path variable in the script with the path to your image file: 
2. python color_detection.py --> Run python script
3. A window will open displaying the image. You can double-click on any pixel in the image to detect its color.
4. The detected color will be displayed in a rectangle along with the color name (e.g., Red, Green, Blue, etc.).
5. Press Esc to exit the program.
